Q.13 :create a Doubly linked-list and write a menu-driven program to perform following operations on it.
1).Insertion at begining.
2).Insertion at end.
3).Deletion at begining.
4).Deletion at ending.
5).Insert before a given node.
6).Insert after a given node.
7).Deletion before a given node.
8).Deletion after a given node.
